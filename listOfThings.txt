Things that we will do differently next time:

Arrange to work at the same time. 
Indeed, 3 people worked on the same week, which allowed to advance the parts correctly. But the last person had not planned to work in
same time as us, so the Pull Requests took time at times and we would have liked to merge our parts faster than that.

Other than that, the communication was good, we all agreed on the commit standards, workflow or Pull Request to use.
It was a good experience.

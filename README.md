### Languages Convention

The world of computer development is formed by many languages, frameworks and development tools. All languages have best practices and writing conventions.
It is very important to follow the conventions set up by the community of the language / framework in question. This allows a symmetry of code between all programs developed with the same language. It is also a way to read and understand anyone's code quickly.
We will see the code conventions for one programming language and one framework.
These are examples and there are conventions for all languages.

Each language has its own conventions but some are common to all languages :
* Follow the DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
* Limit line length
* Keep the code simple


##### Convention in C language

To write code following best practices, you must first learn about naming conventions.
For example in the C language :

Variables and functions are written in [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) :
```
int nbPeoples;
openFile();
```

In C language, the files are organized this way :
```
  /* macros ============================================================== */
  /* constants =========================================================== */
  /* types =============================================================== */
  /* structures ========================================================== */
  /* private variables =================================================== */
  /* private functions =================================================== */
  /* internal public functions =========================================== */
  /* entry points ======================================================== */
  /* public variables ==================================================== */
```

##### Convention in Symfony Framework

The symfony framework also follows the writing of functions, methods and variables in [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)
For the configuration of parameters and twig template variables, use the [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)
For naming PHP namespaces and classes, use the [UpperCamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)


The naming conventions used are different depending on what is needed, which makes it possible to quickly identify variables and functions of PHP classes for example.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of Symfony conventions
* Add a single space after each comma delimiter;
* Add a single space around binary operators (==, &&, ...), with the exception of the concatenation (.) operator;
* Use return null; when a function explicitly returns null values and use return; when the function returns void values;
* Declare public methods first, then protected ones and finally private ones. The exceptions to this rule are the class constructor and the setUp() and tearDown() methods of PHPUnit tests, which must always be the first methods to increase readability;

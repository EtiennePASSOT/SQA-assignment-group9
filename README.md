### Pair programming

**What's pair programming ?**

Pair programming is a development method where two developers code on the same computer. The first, the one who writes the code is called the driver and the second observer assists the driver by correcting potential errors and proposing development alternatives.

**Quality and Productivity**
Even though this practice is often abandoned by companies that think it is a waste of human resources, several studies have looked at the relative productivity of a pair of programmers versus a single programmer.
This study has proven that in terms of productivity, pair programming allows to accelerate development times especially for projects requiring a quick implementation of the solution on the market.
Pair programming allows a faster bug detection thanks to the observation of the pair programmer who realizes a code review in real time and throughout the activity. The applications created are therefore of better quality with a testing requiring less work.
The extra cost of staff (2 developers for 1) is very well compensated by the increase in development quality which allows to detect errors earlier. Indeed, the later a bug is detected, the more expensive it is to correct it.

**Communication and Team spirit**

Pair programming is a social activity that requires the ability to work in a team. It allows to develop the communication skills of the different collaborators to form a strong team spirit.
This team spirit significantly improves the well-being of the employees in their work and therefore the productivity and quality of the work provided. Indeed, many surveys have shown that more than 90% of developers prefer to program in pairs rather than alone.


**Indicators of non-performance**

Beware of non-performance indicators that can be a brake on au pair programming. When training pairs, it is important to choose the employees who will work together according to the objectives of the activity.

* Silence: Pair programming requires you to program aloud and share your point of view with your partner. Persistent silence indicates a lack of collaboration.
* Disengagement: One member loses interest in the project and goes about his or her business.
* Deletion: When one member is more experienced than another, the novice is content to watch the expert perform the majority of the development tasks.
* Relationship problems: the two members of the pair do not get along and do not wish to work together.


Pair programming is therefore a good alternative to development alone. It allows the development of communication skills that are essential for teamwork. In companies, it is also used to quickly transfer skills.

### Pull request

**What's a pull request ?**

A pull request in programming could be defined as a way to ask for a code review on a feature or a piece of code we have done and on which we want a feedback from our colleagues. It's a very useful and a common way in programming to ensure that the code is working correctly, following the coding styles and convention that have been chose for the project and mostly that the piece of code is able to be added to the existing one without any problem.

**How to create a pull request in GitHub**

First, you need to commit and push a piece of code on the branch you are working on. This can be done either on GitHub directly, by using and IDE or even using terminal with Git command.

Then, you have to on your GitHub repository, in the pull request section.
Click on the button "New pull request", select first the branch where you want to merge the code and second, the branch from which you want to merge i.e the branch where you just pushed your code.

You will see the comparison page which draw you the differences between the two branches you are going to merge including the previous commit on the destination branch if there are already some, and the files that have been updated with their content and more.
Click on "Create pull request"

Finally, add a title to your pull request and comments if needed. Aside from this, you will be able to assign yourself and people involved if there are some, and select one or more reviewers that must approve your changes before merge.
To finalize your pull create, click on "Create pull request" or the down arrow if you want to just draft the pull request at the moment.

### Pair programming

**What's pair programming ?**

Pair programming is a development method where two developers work on the same computer. The first, the one who writes the code is called the driver and the second, the observer, assists the driver by correcting potential errors and proposing development alternatives.

**Quality and Productivity**
Even though this practice is often abandoned by companies that think it is a waste of human resources, several studies have looked at the relative productivity of a pair of programmers versus a single programmer.
This study has proven that in terms of productivity, pair programming allows to accelerate development times especially for projects requiring a quick implementation of the solution on the market.
Pair programming allows a faster bug detection thanks to the observation of the pair programmer who realizes a code review in real time and throughout the activity. The applications created are therefore of better quality with a testing requiring less work.
The extra cost of staff (2 developers for 1) is very well compensated by the increase in development quality which allows to detect errors earlier. Indeed, the later a bug is detected, the more expensive it is to correct it.

**Communication and Team spirit**

Pair programming is a social activity that requires the ability to work in a team. It allows to develop the communication skills of the different collaborators to form a strong team spirit.
This team spirit significantly improves the well-being of the employees in their work and therefore the productivity and quality of the work provided. Indeed, many surveys have shown that more than 90% of developers prefer to program in pairs rather than alone.


**Indicators of non-performance**

Beware of non-performance indicators that can be a brake on pair programming. When training pairs, it is important to choose the employees who will work together according to the objectives of the activity.

* Silence: Pair programming requires you to program aloud and share your point of view with your partner. Persistent silence indicates a lack of collaboration.
* Disengagement: One member loses interest in the project and will go about their business.
* Deletion: When one member is more experienced than another, the novice is content to watch the expert perform the majority of the development tasks.
* Relationship problems: the two members of the pair do not get along and do not wish to work together.


Pair programming is therefore a good alternative to development alone. It allows the development of communication skills that are essential for teamwork. In companies, it is also used to quickly transfer skills.

###Checklist

**The importance of checklists**

Checklists, in support of development and organization tools, are an essential tool for project monitoring and task completion. They allow you to note all the important points and discuss / carry out on the project during one day for example.

**Checklists for code reviews**

It is important to address this point in the coding review section because this tool can also be used for code reviews.
You can write down all the points to be discussed, the important things to check. Once a task is done, just check the corresponding box. It's also a tool that will free space in our memory and allow us to concentrate on the essential tasks in the work. In fact, instead of keeping in the corner of our head all the tasks we have to do, we write them down as we think about them and thus free up space in our brain to concentrate at best.

**Checklists Tools**

There are a large number of tools for making checklists called ToDoApps. On a smartphone or computer, it is up to you to choose the tool that suits you best.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of several applications:

* Any.do
* Todoist
* Microsoft To-do
* Google Task

**To go further**

It is possible with some tools like Trello or Github project to go further.
These two tools allow you to create action lists more detailed than a simple checklist. You can create lists and detail the checklist, comment on it, assign people to the task. Several other options are available that you can discover by testing the application and choose the one that suits you.
In the case of Trello and Github Project, you can also automate tasks related to git commits. For example, when the task number (which is called a ticket) is quoted in a commit, the task is checked.

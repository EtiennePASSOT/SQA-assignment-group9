### Languages Convention

The world of computer development is formed by many languages, frameworks and development tools. All languages have best practices and writing conventions.
It is very important to follow the conventions set up by the community of the language / framework in question. This allows a symmetry of code between all programs developed with the same language. It is also a way to read and understand anyone's code quickly.
We will see the code conventions for two programming languages and one framework.
These are examples and there are conventions for all languages.
